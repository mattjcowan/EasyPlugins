This plugin has an IEasyPlugin, and a NonEasyPlugin. The manifest says to use the NonEasyPlugin with a reference to an assembly and type name.

We are adding a few dummy package references to make sure that the NonEasyPlugin plugin is found amidst multiple assembly references included in the plugin.
